# this Dockerfile is based on
# https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-create-an-angular-dockerfile-75c059e7f8e8
# it's supposed to only be included in pattern-orchestra and is used for building
# Docker images for Angular submodules/repos where the dist/ directory has already
# been pre-built, to decrease image sizes and build times.
